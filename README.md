# traceroute-app

<h2>This is a basic traceroute command implementaion in node.js and python.</h2>
<h2>Warnnig : </h2> 
<p>This module does not tell the exact location of routers every time, there is lot 
of real life complexity in finding exact location by ip address. and python version still needs to be 
implemented.</p2>
<p>
This module runs traceroute in subprocess in shell and can prints all 
kind of info about network router like there ip address, country and city in which they are located.
